Valid Operations for a Stack (LIFO)

Operation	Allowed?	Why?
push(value)	✅ Yes	Adds an element to the top of the stack
pop()	✅ Yes	Removes the top element
peek()	✅ Yes	Returns the top element without removing it
length	✅ Yes	Helps track the size of the stack
slice(0, n)	✅ Yes	Can be used to view stack contents without modifying them
splice()	❌ No	Modifies elements in the middle, breaking LIFO order
shift()	❌ No	Removes from the front, which is not how a stack works
unshift(value)	❌ No	Adds to the front, breaking the top-based structure


Valid Operations for a Queue (FIFO)

Operation	        Allowed?	                        Why?
enqueue(value)      (Using push(value))✅ Yes	    Adds to the end of the queue
dequeue()           (Using shift())	✅ Yes	        Removes from the front, following FIFO
front()             (Using queue[0])   ✅ Yes	    Returns the first element without removing it
length	            ✅ Yes	                        Helps track queue size
splice(0, 1)	    ✅ Yes	                        Can be used as an alternative to shift() for dequeuing
pop()	            ❌ No	                        Removes from the end, breaking FIFO order
unshift(value)	    ❌ No	                        Adds to the front, breaking the back-based insertion rule
